# ResilientVoiceToText
Recently, i talk with a partner complainning about stability of connexion to cloud when trying to use some cloud services (in his case, it was a  VoiceToText service).

We had a little talk around cloud pattern, connexion glitch and gremlins, environment impact on the felt stablityof the application, especially in an very noisy environment (professionnal show, ...).
We design a different architecture ni order to make the application more resilient,  highly increasing the felt stability and usage efficiency.
